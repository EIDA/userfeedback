Please provide the following information in the content of the issue:
* Type of client used
* Stations and time windows requested (try to keep it to a minimum)
* snippet of code if feasible (e.g. 2-3 important lines from Obspy or
command from console)
* details about the authentication (e.g. using arclink user? using an
EIDA token?) If a token is used, the user could copy-paste the readable
part where all attributes are present. NOT the full token! (That is private)
* screenshot or copy/paste of the error
* when was this exactly done?
